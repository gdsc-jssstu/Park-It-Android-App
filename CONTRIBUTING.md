### Issues

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/github/docs/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. As a general rule, we don’t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Pull Request

When you are ready to start working on an issue, you can open a pull request (PR) in the repository. PRs are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you open a PR, you’re proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in green and red.
Maintianer will review your PR and if it meets the requirements, it will be merged.
